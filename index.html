<h1>Micromanaging the Micropremie <br /><span class="smaller">Donnal Walter, MD, PhD</span></h1>

<p>Although the human newborn requires much care, physiologically a term infant is largely self-regulating. He or she can demand or refuse milk according to need, eliminate digestive and metabolic wastes, and adjust breathing to closely tune the internal biochemical milieu. The premature, by contrast, can do almost none of this effectively, the earlier the less so. The earliest and smallest, the "micropremie", requires close outside attention to every aspect of its physiology simply to survive. On top of this, the micropremie, still a fetus in many ways, has much growing and developing to do before it can be cared for at home. Critical care of the micropremie requires careful attention to innumerable details over many weeks and months.</p>

<p><img src="./tiny/premie.jpg" width="276" height="183" alt="premie" />The term "micromanagement" is often used disparagingly to describe a management style that devotes excessive attention to minor details. This essay turns that definition on its head, insisting first that few details are minor or unimportant in the care of the micropremie, while admitting second that attention is not an unlimited resource. We therefore define <strong><em>micromanaging</em></strong> as <strong>attending to detail in ways that minimize the effort required</strong>, allowing such effort to be focused and effective.</p>

<p>This is an enormous undertaking. In time, we will address each body system and every aspect of care, but the logical starting point would seem to be <strong>fluids and nutrition</strong>. This fundamental concern extends from the hour of admission to the day of discharge, and for much of that time the number of variables potentially to be considered daily is enormous. Moreover, adequately managing the nutritional needs of the micropremie is calculation intensive. Micromanaging this aspect of care will therefore require: (1) a systematic approach to dealing with many data elements, and (2) a comprehensive approach to calculations that are performed seamlessly and automatically.</p>

<p>In the NICUs at ACH and UAMS, patient care is coordinated through the <strong>Epic</strong> <acronym title="electronic health record">EHR</acronym>, both ordering and documenting care. Epic is specifically designed to handle large volumes of discrete data, so this is not an issue. It is also quite capable of performing calculations, but as far as I can ascertain, Epic is <em>not designed</em> to support large numbers of simultaneous (seamless) calculations, and therein lies the rub. Later in this essay, or perhaps on a separate page, I will begin to explore options for handling this situation as I understand it. Before taking on the <a href="./epic.html">technical issues</a>, however, I will first formally describe the <a href="#fen">clinical requirements</a>.</p> 

<p>It should also be noted that while care of the micropremie may be the most challenging scenario, every newborn receiving critical care should receive similar attention to detail.</p> 

<h2 id="fen">Fluids and Nutrition: Clinical Requirements</h2>

<h3>Parenteral Nutrition</h3>
<p>The smallest neonatal patients cannot be fed initially, often for days or weeks. Such patients must receive water and nutrients by way of vascular access, so-called parenteral nutrition (PN). The volume of PN and its composition are specified in an order generated by the provider daily and submitted to Pharmacy, where the fluid is prepared using an automated compounder. A clinical pharmacist reviews every PN order prior to transferring it to the compounder. The resulting PN bag is sent to the NICU with a detailed label, which is compared by the nurse to the original order prior to starting its administration. This essay will focus on the generation of the daily PN order, but how that order is reviewed by pharmacy, transferred to the compounder, reviewed again by nursing, administered, and documented are crucial details as well. </p>

<p>The daily PN order is generated by a licensed provider (<acronym title="licensed independent provider">LIP</acronym>) typically before or after discussion with an attending neonatologist, where they consider the volume to be infused (thus its rate) and the composition of the fluid. In principle, the composition could be specified by the concentrations or the absolute amounts of individual constituents, but clinicians typically think in terms of amounts per unit weight (per kg) per day. The primary exception to this is dextrose where the concentration (D5W, D6W, D10W, D12.5W, etc.) or the glucose infusion rate (GIR) in mg/kg/min is considered. (It is helpful to be able to calculate this relationship in either direction.) The principal constituents are dextrose (glucose), protein (amino acids), and electrolyte solutions (such as NaCl, KCl, NaAcetate, etc.). It is helpful for  the sums of individual ions (such as Na, K, and so on) to be calculated at the same time. The provider may also order other additives, such as trace elements, vitamins, and a limited number of medications for continuous infusion. More on the various constituents can be found </p>

<p>Although administered separately, a lipid emulsion is considered part of the PN order. It can be seen that the PN order is complex in its own right, not only with volumes and administration rates, but with a number of weight-based constituents of different types. On top of this, there are a number of other calculations that are helpful in determining the appropriate order. These include total calories, the relative calories of protein, carbohydrate, and fat, the osmolarity of the solution, the limits of calcium and phosphorus, and more. Finally, although the provider does not need to know how it is made up, he or she does need to know that the fluid can be compounded as ordered (the "negative water" issue). </p>

<h3>Other Intravenous Fluids</h3>
<p>The micropremie may receive other IV fluids, particularly medications, either by continuous infusion or by IV bolus with flush. Strictly speaking these are not part of the nutritional plan for the patient. They must be considered, however, especially with regard to how they contribute to the total volume and the amount of glucose and sodium received. For larger patients, this contribution is largely insignificant, but for the micropremie it can be critical.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the clinician may elect to "Y in" another fluid to provide additional volume, change the glucose infusion rate, or give more sodium or other electrolytes. This might occur when enteral feedings are stopped or held, for example, or when the current PN fluid is otherwise considered inadequate before a new bag can be ordered and made up.</p>

<h3>Enteral Nutrition</h3>
<p>The immature GI tract of the micropremie cannot tolerate full enteral nutrition (EN) for considerable time following birth, but maturation requires slowly advancing enteral intake. The safest and most efficacious food is mother's own milk expressed and administered to the GI tract via tube. Donor breast milk is considered second best. Beyond this, there are a number of commercial infant formulas available. The composition of breast milk and the various formulas varies enough to warrant consideration at the time it is being ordered, not only in selecting the one most appropriate, but in calculating the resulting nutrients. </p>
<p>Once the volume has been advanced to a given point, it is often helpful to mix in certain products to provide additional calories, protein, fiber, and so on. These additives become part of the EN order sent to the milk lab or formula room. Some additives may be added to the feeding at the bedside by the nurse. These are also part of the EN order.</p>
<p>But that's not the end of it. The EN order must also specify how the milk or formula is to be given. Typically by tube at first, what kind of tube? And how much volume with what frequency (or rate if continuous)? By the time the order is complete, it can become quite complicated.</p>

<h3 id="tiny"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="cap">T</span>otal <span class="cap">I</span>nfant <span class="cap">N</span>utrition <span class="cap">Y</span>es &mdash;</span> TINY</h3>
<p>Parenteral and enteral nutrition and other fluids must be considered together as components of a <strong>unified nutritional plan</strong>. Moreover, in the ideal situation it should be possible to submit a single order for this unified plan. This is because alterations in one component change the clinical thinking about the other components, and the influence can go in either (or any) direction. Ideally the clinical team should think about and calculate changes to all components together.  It will be objected that each of the components involves a different order type, and admittedly that is a problem. But this is a technical problem, not a workflow issue. From the viewpoint of clinical workflow, total infant nutrition should be addressed as though it were a single order.</p>

<p>It goes without saying, however, no one wants to rewrite the entire nutritional plan every day (or each time a change is made to any component). For that matter, no one wants to rewrite even one component entirely whenever a change is made. Every component is complex in its own right, and for safety concerns, not to mention efficiency, the starting point for any new order or orders must be the current order for each component. That much is essential.</p>

<p>It could also be objected that the clinical team may want to change just one component of the nutritional plan without changing the others, but again that would seem to be a technical issue. Even though the other components remain unchanged, clinically they should be considered at the same time.</p>
